# Test It Out

This is a Unity project for a serious game called Test It Out. Developed Fall of 2019

This is a simulation game where you play as a teacher and must decide the best way to instruct your students. You must maximize their test scores to appease the school administration, but also keep class morale high so students do not drop out.
